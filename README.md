# OSS Mid Term Project
- Build Self-Introducing Webserver
# How does it consist?
- You can see the webpage in link[hochacha.com]
- From now, I use Docker container for easy deployment by making some scripts.
- However, to be more fault-tolerance, I'm just looking for deploy webserver in Kubernetes
- (maybe minimalized version of K8s, such as minikube or k3s due to small amout of computer resources)
